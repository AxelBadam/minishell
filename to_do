- cd not working 
- has to do with (path)

- clearing and freeing lst after child has executed

- malloc protection
- error_handling
- signals

-----------------
- access checks for for files and directory check
exit_status
126 = is not executable
127 = command not found
2 = incorrect usage; invalid options or missing arguments

status > 0 = error during expansion or redirection


cmd check:
-if binary not found 
	print: "command not found"

--------------------------------------
-if not builtin and is dir,
	"is a directory"
-if not builtin and no access F_OK, 
	"no such file or directory"
-if not builtin and no perm, 
	"permission denied"


fork check:
-if output or input fd == -1, 
	get out
-if access(X_OK) == 0, || is_builtin,
	do fork
-else if not a builtin and file exists || is dir
	g_status= 126
-else if not a builtin
	status = command not found (127)


if not builtin nor binary, its a program in the current dir (check access):

-fix basic either in fork check or cm check
